Wordpress event project management  plugin: track tasks, create budgets, store note, document meeting minutes and display it all on the front-end for user involvement. 

== Description ==
[PT Project Notebooks](https://www.mjssoftware.com) is the latest and greatest event and group management tool available on WordPress.

Our core platform is free, flexible, and driven by its users. The freedom of open-source means you retain full ownership of your project’s content and data forever.

Whether you’re organizing your own project, chairing a committee, or managing an event for your school, church, sports team, or any other organization type, use Project Notebooks for a project management tool that blends simplicity with detail.

- Take and **manage unlimited meeting minutes**
- **Track important due dates and tasks** that will auto-update based on your event date selection.
- Document **general notes** for the project itself
- **Manage a budget** with revenue and expense items
- Visually manage key steps with a **Kanban board**
- Keep **key information** at the top of your list with a dedicated informational board
- Post **unlimited notebooks** to the frontend – great for posting meeting minutes!
- **Store attachments** for your event and avoid the ‘we lost it!’ cry

Built-in tools and a simple-to-use interface help you efficiently manage your next big project or event with ease. Transitioning the management of projects or committees from user to user is as easy as adding the new person as an administrator of the project – allowing users like Committee Chairs to easily pass their work on to the next chair.

- **Only use the components you want when setting up a PT Project Notebook.** Don’t over clutter your project with items that don’t make sense.
- **Publish your PT Project Notebook to allow interested parties to see what is expected if they were to take over the project.** Great for volunteer recruitment!
- **Front-end editing access** to make it as easy as possible for your PT Project Notebook managers.
